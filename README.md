# Cyclistic - Business Intelligence Dashboard Building
In this project, I created data visualizations, a low fidelity mockup to help plannign the components and layout of your dashboard, charts to be included in your visualization, and a dashboard for Cyclistic. I also completed an executive summary document that describes to Cyclistic stakeholders the business needs, project goals, dashboard functionality, and BI methods.
